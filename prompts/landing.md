Use the ShadCN MCP server to bring in necessary components to build a SaaS landing page to spin up and spin down a container for railway.com. The website should be called "Railway Fullstack Assessment"

The design should be fully fluid.

Integrate a navebar with a logo on the left, a primary nave in the middle with 3 links, and a navbar CTP buttons on the right that says "Sign Up" and "Login".
The Sign Up should be emphasized with the primary color, login secondary.

The hero section should span 100vh, a feature a large headline that is aligned top of the design with good white space away from the browser edges.
The headline should say "Spin up and Spin down a container for railway.com" with a CTA button to "Sign Up".
The background of this hero section will eventually an interactive background element, designate a div that sits behind everything for this purpose and label it as such.
